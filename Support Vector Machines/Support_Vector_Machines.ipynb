    "# Support Vector Machines\n",
    "\n",
    "A Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a powerful supervised machine learning model used for classification. An SVM makes classifications by defining a decision boundary and then seeing what side of the boundary an unclassified point falls on. In the next few exercises, we’ll learn how these decision boundaries get defined, but for now, know that they’re defined by using a training set of classified points. That’s why SVMs are supervised machine learning models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Decision boundaries are easiest to wrap your head around when the data has two features. In this case, the decision boundary is a line. Take a look at the example below.\n",

    "Two clusters of points separated by a line\n",
    "Note that if the labels on the figures in this lesson are too small to read, you can resize this pane to increase the size of the images.\n",
    "\n",
    "This SVM is using data about fictional games of Quidditch from the Harry Potter universe! The classifier is trying to predict whether a team will make the playoffs or not. Every point in the training set represents a “historical” Quidditch team. Each point has two features — the average number of goals the team scores and the average number of minutes it takes the team to catch the Golden Snitch.\n",
    "\n",
    "After finding a decision boundary using the training set, you could give the SVM an unlabeled data point, and it will predict whether or not that team will make the playoffs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Decision boundaries exist even when your data has more than two features. If there are three features, the decision boundary is now a plane rather than a line.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/three_dimensions.png\" style=\"width: 400px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Two clusters of points in three dimensions separated by a plane.\n",
    "As the number of dimensions grows past 3, it becomes very difficult to visualize these points in space. Nonetheless, SVMs can still find a decision boundary. However, rather than being a separating line, or a separating plane, the decision boundary is called a separating hyperplane."

    "\n",
    "SVMs are supervised machine learning models used for classification.\n",
    "An SVM uses support vectors to define a decision boundary. Classifications are made by comparing unlabeled points to that decision boundary.\n",
    "Support vectors are the points of each class closest to the decision boundary. The distance between the support vectors and the decision boundary is called the margin.\n",
    "SVMs attempt to create the largest margin possible while staying within an acceptable amount of error.\n",
    "The C parameter controls how much error is allowed. A large C allows for little error and creates a hard margin. A small C allows for more error and creates a soft margin.\n",
    "SVMs use kernels to classify points that aren’t linearly separable.\n",
    "Kernels transform points into higher dimensional space. A polynomial kernel transforms points into three dimensions while an rbf kernel transforms points into infinite dimensions.\n",
    "An rbf kernel has a gamma parameter. If gamma is large, the training data is more relevant, and as a result overfitting can occur."
