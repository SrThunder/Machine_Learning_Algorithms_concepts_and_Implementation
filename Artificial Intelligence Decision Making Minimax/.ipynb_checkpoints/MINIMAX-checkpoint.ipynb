    "# MINIMAX\n",
    "## Games as Trees\n",
    "Have you ever played a game against someone and felt like they were always two steps ahead? No matter what clever move you tried, they had somehow envisioned it and had the perfect counterattack. This concept of thinking ahead is the central idea behind the minimax algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "The minimax algorithm is a decision-making algorithm that is used for finding the best move in a two player game. It’s a recursive algorithm — it calls itself. In order for us to determine if making move A is a good idea, we need to think about what our opponent would do if we made that move.\n",
    "\n",
    "We’d guess what our opponent would do by running the minimax algorithm from our opponent’s point of view. In the hypothetical world where we made move A, what would they do? Surely they want to win as badly as we do, so they’d evaluate the strength of their move by thinking about what we would do if they made move B.\n",
    "\n",
    "As this process repeats, we can start to make a tree of these hypothetical game states. We’ll eventually reach a point where the game is over — we’ll reach a leaf of the tree. Either we won, our opponent won, or it was a tie. At this point, the recursion can stop. Because the game is over, we no longer need to think about how our opponent would react if we reached this point of the game."

    "For the rest of this exercise, we’re going to be writing the minimax algorithm to be used on a game of Tic-Tac-Toe. We’ve imported a Tic-Tac-Toe game engine in the file tic_tac_toe.py. Before starting to write the minimax function, let’s play around with some of the Tic-Tac-Toe functions we’ve defined for you in tic_tac_toe.py.\n",
    "\n",
    "To begin, a board is represented as a list of lists. In script.py we’ve created a board named my_board where the X player has already made the first move. They’ve chosen the top right corner. To nicely print this board, use the print_board() function using my_board as a parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we want to be able to take a turn. The select_space() function lets us do this. Select space takes three parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The board that you want to take the turn on.\n",
    "* The space that you want to fill in. This should be a number between 1 and 9.\n",
    "* The symbol that you want to put in that space. This should be a string — either an \"X\" or an \"O\".\n",
    "* We can also get a list of the available spaces using available_moves() and passing the board as a parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we can check to see if someone has won the game. The has_won() function takes the board and a symbol (either \"X\" or \"O\"). It returns True if that symbol has won the game, and False otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s test these functions! Write your code in script.py, but feel free to take a look at tic_tac_toe.py if you want to look at how the game engine works."

    "A game can be represented as a tree. The current state of the game is the root of the tree, and each potential move is a child of that node. The leaves of the tree are game states where the game has ended (either in a win or a tie).\n",
    "The minimax algorithm returns the best possible move for a given game state. It assumes that your opponent will also be using the minimax algorithm to determine their best move.\n",
    "Game states can be evaluated and given a specific score. This is relatively easy when the game is over — the score is usually a 1, -1 depending on who won. If the game is a tie, the score is usually a 0.\n",
    "In our next lesson on the minimax algorithm, we’ll look at games that are more complex than Tic Tac Toe. How does the algorithm change if it’s too computationally intensive to reach the leaves of the game tree? What strategies can we use to traverse the tree in a smarter way? We’ll tackle these questions in our next lesson!"
